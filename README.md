This is all you need to create a working Postgresql 9.4 image + PhpPgadmin already configured to allow access from remote hosts.

It will provide a working ubuntu 14.04 environment with utils and tools such as vim, curl, wget, net-tools and build-essentials

You can either download the repository and run:

> docker build -t alex0494/pgsqlserver:1.0 .

to build the image locally, or you can run

> docker run -d --name pgsqlserver -p 8081:80 alex0494/postgresqlserver

to download the pre-built image from my dockerhub

You can find the image @ dockerhub.com/alex0494/pgsqlserver

edit1:

to access phppgadmin afert you launched the image, in your browser type: 

> localhost:8081/phppgadmin

if the server responds with a 402: UNAUTHORIZED:

> sudo docker exec -i -t <container-id> /bin/bash

> vim /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/phppgadmin.conf

comment out or remove “Require local”, and restart the container.

Enjoy.
